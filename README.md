This module uses only built in python3 functions to return user input (e.g., -123.5433333) as a string formatted into a currency value of choice (either U.S. Dollar, European Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, or Chinese Yuan).  

The user is prompted to enter a real number and again prompted to choose a currency from a list of five currencies.
